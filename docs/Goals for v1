Gather Data:

	1) CPU Utilization every minute (note: Global average only, not per-core)
		a. CPU Utilization
	2) Memory every 5 minutes (note: Global average only, not per-NUMA-node)
		a. Buffer Cache Hit Ratio
		b. Page Life Expectancy
	3) Disk Latency (note: data per file: mdf, ndf, log)
		a. Read/Write/Average Latency
		b. Bytes per Read/Write/Transfer
		c. Disk, DatabaseName, filenames (+path)
	4) Blocking (note: gather daily and delete previous data since the last server restart)
		a. Basic cumulative blocking per DB object
		b. Analysis? Add cumulative times between restarts at check period
		c. Analysis? Perhaps both expression of absolute time and relative % of processing time?
	5) Deadlocks?
		a. This is iffy…first, do I want to track them at all? If so, just number, or more data?
	6) Wait States
		a. No, start with basics, perhaps just the top 10 at a time, and clear the DMV after gathering data. Later, pull it together, compare it to total processing time available, and provide basic ratings and recommendations on the data

		h. Remember that this DMV can be cleared on-demand:

			i. The takeaway is that waits are not correlated with system resource usage. So, EoM reporting leveraging analysis of resource usage : CPU + RAM + Disk (though ram/disk can be directly related (check PLE for thrashing) is more important than waits, which should be a confirming/disproving factor than a metric in and of itself
