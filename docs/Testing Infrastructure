v1.0 - 2025-11-29

With the final 3 initial data gathering modules in progress, I decided it was necessary to formalize how the testing
infrastrucutre is designed and how load testing is done.

Basic development and testing has been and will continue to be done on a SQL Server 2012 using a case-sensitive collation
    [Latin1_General_BIN] initially; perhaps others later

The data sets to be used will depend on version of SQL server:

    AdventureWorks: 2012, 2014, 2016 ; at time of writing, I am planning to swap to WWI at or after SQL 2016
    Stack Overflow: 2012+ (larger data set)
    World Wide Importers: 2016+

As mentioned, the initial setup is SQL Server 2012, which is running on an RTM installation of Windows Server 2012 R2
    Note: There is a single patch installed: 2018-05 Security Only Quality Update for Windows Server 2012 R2 for x64-based Systems (KB4103715)
        This is to allow RDP into the box from newer versions of Windows

The hardware specifications:
    vCPU:   2
    RAM:    8gb
    Disks:  C = 128gb
            D = 50gb
            M = 2gb [This is the mount point for non-lettered LUNs]

Instance-Specific Disks are allocated based on my old infrastructure documentation from 2013. All SQL disks are mount points to be able to evaluate
disk space data gathering for non-lettered disks

Once I'm satisfied that the first version of Pulse is ready for release, I'll deploy a complete running infrastructure to validate 
as many variants of Windows/SQL as possible.
